This extension inserts the daily Calvin & Hobbes comic as a single image in your currently focused block.

How it works:
- Use the Command Palette and select "Daily Calvin & Hobbes".
- Or use Smartblocks with `<%CALVINHOBBES%>`.
- The block briefly shows "Loading..." and then updates to the image markdown.
- If the request fails, the block shows a failure message.

Example strip: `https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2022/08/09`

Notes:
- Requires network access to `https://c-h.onrender.com`.
- The embedded image is hosted on GoComics CDN domains.
- Availability depends on those external services.
